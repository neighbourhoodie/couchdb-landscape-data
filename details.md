# CouchDB

Apache CouchDB ™ lets you access your data where you need it. The [Couch Replication Protocol](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/replication/protocol.html) is implemented in a variety of projects and products that span every imaginable computing environment from **globally distributed server-clusters**, over **mobile phones** to **web browsers**. Store your data **safely**, on your own servers, or with any leading cloud provider. Your web- and native applications love CouchDB, because it speaks **JSON natively** and supports **binary data** for all your data storage needs.
The [Couch Replication Protocol](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/replication/protocol.html) lets your data flow seamlessly between server clusters to mobile phones and web browsers, enabling a compelling [offline-first](https://offlinefirst.org/) user-experience while maintaining high performance and strong reliability. CouchDB comes with a **developer-friendly** query language, and optionally MapReduce for simple, efficient, and comprehensive data retrieval.

## Key Advantages

- **Couch Replication Protocol:** A custom protocol for syncing JSON documents P2P is behind CouchDB and makes it a first choice for distributed systems. Starting a replication is as simple as a single request or a few clicks through Fauxton, CouchDB’s out-of-the-box UI. 
- **HTTP/JSON API:** Because it uses the CouchDB REST API, CouchDB is an HTTP server where practically everything in CouchDB has a URL. The flexibility means CouchDB works with any stack and you can get going without libraries.
- **Designed for reliability:** CouchDB won’t lose your data. Ever. It takes [preventing data corruption](https://neighbourhood.ie/blog/2025/02/26/how-couchdb-prevents-data-corruption-fsync) very seriously, and all processes — including long-running replications — are resumable and designed to be interrupted.
